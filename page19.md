### Accounting Value Adjustments and Impairments

If an impairment no longer has a reason to persist, the carrying amount of an asset (or of the cash-generating unit to which it belongs), with the exception of goodwill, is adjusted to the recoverable amount or to its new estimate. However, this adjustment cannot exceed the net carrying amount that the asset would have held if the original impairment had not been recorded, considering the relevant amortizations. The reinstated value is directly recorded in the income statement.

### Investments in Subsidiaries

Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at their acquisition cost. To assess the adequacy of carrying amounts, these investments are subjected to an impairment test. If the results indicate that the value is lower than the carrying amount, adjustments are recorded as an impairment loss in the income statement. During subsequent years, if the impairment reasons cease to exist, the investment values are revaluated and adjusted upwards to their original carrying amounts, with the effects recognized in the income statement.

### Inventory

Inventory consists of raw materials and finished goods, valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost is determined using the weighted average method. The cost of finished goods directly produced by the company (up until and including the Spring-Summer 2022 season) includes raw materials, labor, and other directly attributable costs of production, excluding financial expenses.  

The estimated net realizable value is based on the selling price predicted under standard business operations, excluding any necessary costs for sale. If there is objective evidence of factors indicating a decline in value, inventory is adjusted to reflect its lower estimated realizable value.

Write-downs are recorded as a reduction of the inventory-related provision directly in the income statement. If the conditions leading to write-downs are no longer present in subsequent fiscal periods, the inventory's value is restored to its historical carrying amount.

### Sales Returns and Liabilities for Expected Refunds

The Company estimates variable considerations to include in the transaction price for sold goods with a right of return. A predictive model is developed based on historical return data by brand, country, and client, as well as the prices obtained in each selling season. These elements help determine the estimated payment for returns. Future changes in variables linked to historical patterns might influence the expected refund liabilities.
