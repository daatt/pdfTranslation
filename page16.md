### 3.2 Accounting Principles Adopted

Below is a brief description of the accounting principles and the most significant valuation criteria used in preparing the Financial Statement.

#### Tangible Fixed Assets

Tangible fixed assets (buildings, plant, and machinery) are recorded at the acquisition or production cost, net of the accumulated depreciation, calculated based on the useful life of the assets.

The historical cost includes expenses directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets.

Subsequent costs (e.g., maintenance and/or repairs) are included in the book value of the assets or recognized as a separate activity only when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with them will flow to the company, and their cost can be reliably measured. If these conditions are not met, the costs are charged to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. The book value of replaced parts is removed from the financial statements. Routine repairs and maintenance costs are recognized in the income statement at the time they are incurred.

Improvements made by third parties to properties owned during renewal phases are amortized only if considered necessary to carry out the intended business activities under the required operating conditions.

Tangible assets are systematically depreciated at a constant rate based on depreciation percentages defined according to their estimated economic-technical useful life, starting from the moment when the asset is available for use. 

The estimated useful life, as determined by the company for the various categories of tangible fixed assets, is as follows:

| **Asset Type**                    | **Useful Life (Years)** |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Industrial buildings              | 33                      |
| Plant and machinery               | 4 - 10                  |
| Office furniture and equipment    | 2 - 10                  |
| Furniture and furnishings         | 3 - 10                  |
| Industrial and commercial tools   | 3 - 8                   |
| Vehicles                          | 4 - 5                   |
| Other transport equipment         | 4 - 5                   |

Leased or third-party goods are amortized based on the shorter duration between the lease agreement and the useful life. 

It is also specified that no depreciation is calculated on industrial and commercial land owned by the company, as these areas are not subject to impairment.
