### Investment and Financing  

The description of the methods through which the Company manages financial risks is included in the section "Risk Management" of this document.

All values disclosed in the financial statement and the related illustrative notes, unless otherwise stated, are expressed in euros.

---

### Accounting Estimates  

This financial statement, prepared in compliance with IFRS, contains estimates and assumptions made by the Group in relation to assets and liabilities, costs, revenues, and potential liabilities as of the balance sheet date. These estimates are based on past experiences and assumptions considered reasonable and realistic, using the information available at the time of the estimate. The assumptions deriving from these estimates are periodically reviewed, and their effects are reflected in the income statement during the period in which they occur. Actual results may therefore differ from those estimates.

The areas of greater uncertainty in the formulation of estimates and evaluations during the application process of IFRS, which have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements, include:

1. Credit risks (note no. 6.8);
2. Inventory obsolescence (note no. 6.7);
3. Recoverability of deferred tax assets (note no. 6.6);
4. Provisions for risks and charges (note no. 6.18);
5. Recoverability of investments (note no. 6.4).

Reference is also made to paragraph 3.2 with regard to the Impairment Test.  
As of the reference date of the financial statements, there are no further significant estimates related to future events, uncertainties, or other causes of uncertainty that could cause material adjustments to the asset and liability values in the subsequent fiscal year.

Estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed, and the effects of changes are reflected in the income statement for the period during which the estimate revision occurs. Revisions are effective only for the current period or for both current and future periods when the revisions have effects beyond the current fiscal year.

---

### Deferred Tax Assets  
Concerning activities involving deferred tax assets, it is highlighted that these assets are recorded in the presence of timing differences, to the extent that it is probable that adequate future taxable income will exist against which such deferred tax assets can be utilized. A significant discretionary evaluation is required by the administrators to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be accounted for. They must estimate the probable occurrence and amount of future taxable income suitable for offsetting, as well as a strategy for fiscal planning.

## 3. Accounting Principles  

The significant accounting principles adopted for the preparation of the financial statements as of 31 December 2023 are described below.

### 3.1 Recently Issued and Approved Accounting Principles  

#### Accounting Principles Effective from 1 January 2023  

Below is a summary of the accounting principles and interpretations newly issued and effective from 1 January 2023, for which no material financial or economic effects have been recorded:  

- **IFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts**  
  In May 2017, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts, defining principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of issued insurance contracts, as well as guiding contracts held for reinsurance and investment contracts with discretionary participation features.  
  In June 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 17 to facilitate its implementation and simplify processes for companies with low financial performance.  

  - Key Application Areas:  
    - **IFRS 9 - Comparative Information (and IFRS 4 – Insurance Contracts)**  
      In December 2021, the IASB issued amendments providing an option for transition related to comparative information on financial assets presented when initially applying IFRS 17. The main objective is to avoid temporary discrepancies in accounting for financial assets and liabilities derived from insurance contracts, thereby improving the utility of comparative information.  
      
  Additionally, amendments extend the expiration date of the temporary exemption for applying IFRS 9 to annual periods beginning as of 1 January 2023 to align with the introduction of IFRS 17.  

- **IAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements & IFRS Practice Statement 2: Policies Disclosure**  
  In February 2021, the IASB issued amendments requiring disclosure of key accounting policies relevant to financial statements instead of those that are merely significant, thereby enhancing clarity about the importance of such policies.  

- **IAS 8 – Accounting Policies, Accounting Estimates, and Errors**  
  In February 2021, amendments were issued to clarify how companies distinguish changes in accounting policies from changes in accounting estimates.  

- **IAS 12 – Income Taxes: Deferred Taxes Related to Assets and Liabilities**  
  Issued in May 2021, these amendments specify how entities account for deferred taxes on transactions such as leasing and decommissioning liabilities, ensuring proper financial reporting.  

- **IFRS 4 – Insurance Contracts**  
  In June 2020, amendments were issued extending the temporary exemption of IFRS 9 application to annual periods starting from 1 January 2023.  

- **IAS 12 – Income Taxes: International Tax Reform - Second Pillar Model Rules**  
  In May 2023, amendments clarified IAS 12's application to address issues relating to the second pillar of international tax reform.

### **Accounting Principles Not Yet Applicable**

The following new principles, amendments, and interpretations will become effective starting 1 January 2024 or later. The Company does not expect any material impact from the adoption of these modifications:

#### IAS 1 - **Presentation of Financial Statements: Current and Non-Current Liabilities Classification**
In January 2020, the IASB issued amendments addressing the classification of debts and other liabilities as current or non-current. In particular, the amendments focus on how liabilities are classified based on regulatory contracts, and liabilities that can be settled immediately through equity conversion. The amendments have not yet been endorsed by the European Union.

#### IAS 1 - **Presentation of Financial Statements: Non-Compliance with Covenants**
In October 2022, the IASB issued amendments clarifying the conditions under which an entity must comply for at least twelve months after the reporting date to influence liability classification. These amendments have not yet been endorsed by the European Union.

#### IFRS 16 - **Leases: Sales and Leasebacks**
In September 2022, the IASB issued amendments aimed at specifying the valuation of liabilities arising from a sale and leaseback transaction to ensure that the seller-lessee does not recognize gains related to the retained use of the asset. These amendments will be effective 1 January 2024.

#### IAS 7 - **Financial Reporting, and IFRS 7 - Financial Instruments: Supplier Finance Arrangements**
In May 2023, the IASB issued amendments introducing new requirements to improve the disclosure of information provided on Supplier Finance Arrangements, aimed at assisting users in understanding their impact on liabilities, cash flows, and liquidity exposure. These amendments will be effective 1 January 2024 or later.

#### IAS 21 - **Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates: Lack of Exchangeability**
In August 2023, the IASB issued amendments to clarify how an entity should apply a consistent approach when assessing the possibility of currency exchangeability and determining the exchange rate to use for conversion informational purposes. These amendments will be effective 1 January 2025 or later.

---

### **Adoption Plan**
The Group intends to adopt these principles and interpretations as applicable, upon their effective dates.

### 3.2 Accounting Principles Adopted

Below is a brief description of the accounting principles and the most significant valuation criteria used in preparing the Financial Statement.

#### Tangible Fixed Assets

Tangible fixed assets (buildings, plant, and machinery) are recorded at the acquisition or production cost, net of the accumulated depreciation, calculated based on the useful life of the assets.

The historical cost includes expenses directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets.

Subsequent costs (e.g., maintenance and/or repairs) are included in the book value of the assets or recognized as a separate activity only when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with them will flow to the company, and their cost can be reliably measured. If these conditions are not met, the costs are charged to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. The book value of replaced parts is removed from the financial statements. Routine repairs and maintenance costs are recognized in the income statement at the time they are incurred.

Improvements made by third parties to properties owned during renewal phases are amortized only if considered necessary to carry out the intended business activities under the required operating conditions.

Tangible assets are systematically depreciated at a constant rate based on depreciation percentages defined according to their estimated economic-technical useful life, starting from the moment when the asset is available for use. 

The estimated useful life, as determined by the company for the various categories of tangible fixed assets, is as follows:

| **Asset Type**                    | **Useful Life (Years)** |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Industrial buildings              | 33                      |
| Plant and machinery               | 4 - 10                  |
| Office furniture and equipment    | 2 - 10                  |
| Furniture and furnishings         | 3 - 10                  |
| Industrial and commercial tools   | 3 - 8                   |
| Vehicles                          | 4 - 5                   |
| Other transport equipment         | 4 - 5                   |

Leased or third-party goods are amortized based on the shorter duration between the lease agreement and the useful life. 

It is also specified that no depreciation is calculated on industrial and commercial land owned by the company, as these areas are not subject to impairment.

### Leased Assets

Lease contracts are accounted for in the balance sheet based on the provisions of accounting standard IFRS 16.

At the time of initiating each lease contract, the company:
- Determines whether the contract contains a lease, which occurs when it grants the right to control the use of a specified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. This evaluation is repeated whenever the terms and conditions of the contract are subsequently modified;
- Separates the contract components, allocating the consideration to each leasing and non-leasing component;
- Defines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of the lease to which any renewal or termination options are added.

From the commencement date of each contract, i.e., from the date when the asset is made available for use, the company recognizes in its balance sheet, under assets, an activity representing the right to use the asset (henceforth referred to as "right-of-use asset") and, under liabilities, an obligation to perform and make the payments required by the lease contract (henceforth referred to as "lease liability"). 

The lease term is determined considering the non-cancellable period of the contract, unless there is reasonable certainty that the options to extend the contract or not to terminate it earlier will be exercised. The lease liability is initially recognized at the current value of the expected payments due for the lease at the commencement date, including: 
1. Fixed payments (or substantially fixed), excluding incentives to be received;
2. Variable payments dependent on indices or rates;
3. Any guaranteed residual value payments to be made by the lessee;
4. The price of an option to purchase the asset, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise it;
5. Penalty payments for early termination of the lease, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise such an option.

The current value of these specified payments is equivalent to the present value of the future payments, discounted using the implicit interest rate for the lease or, as an alternative, the company's incremental borrowing rate. Subsequently, the "right-of-use" is valuated using the cost model, net of accumulated depreciation and adjusted to account for possible revaluations or modifications in the lease. The lease liability, on the other hand, is revaluated by increasing or decreasing its book value to account for interest expenses, diminishing it by the amounts paid, and re-determining its book value to consider potential revaluations or lease contract modifications.

Assets are depreciated based on an amortization period equal to the shorter duration between:
- The lease term; and 
- The useful life of the asset, assuming a reasonable certainty regarding the asset's transfer to the lessee at the end of the lease term. If not applicable, the amortization period is calculated based on the useful life criteria applied to tangible fixed assets.

For lease contracts with a duration of less than 12 months from the beginning of the application and that do not include renewal options or for contracts related to low-value assets, lease payments are recognized as expenses in the income statement in a straight-line manner over the term of the respective contracts.

## Intangible Assets  

Intangible assets are non-monetary identifiable assets without physical substance, under the company's control, capable of generating future economic benefits for the enterprise. Initial recognition is performed at acquisition cost, including any expenses directly attributable to the preparation of the asset for its intended use, production, or when there are conditions for capitalizing expenses incurred for activities carried out internally.

For subsequent recognition, the cost method is used, registering the asset at cost net of cumulative amortization and impairment losses ("Impairment").

Intangible assets primarily include:  
- Licensing rights or similar rights acquired from third parties.

Licenses include those for corporate software. IT projects also include the costs for acquiring licenses, as well as those incurred for their development and installation. Licenses are amortized based on their useful life.

Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis from the moment they are available for use. The applicable rates are as follows:  
- **Licenses**: 20% - 25%  
- **Other Intangible Assets**: 20% - 25%  

---

### Impairment Losses and Impairment Test  

IAS 36 requires that, in the presence of indicators, events, or changes in circumstances that suggest a possible impairment, an impairment test should be carried out. This ensures that intangible and tangible assets with a defined useful life are not recorded at a value exceeding their recoverable amount. This assessment is conducted at least annually for assets with an indefinite useful life, regardless of the presence of impairment indicators.  

The recoverable amount of recorded values is ascertained by comparing the carrying amount as of the reference date with the higher of the fair value net of selling costs (if available) and the value in use. The "value in use" of a tangible or intangible asset is determined based on the estimated future financial flows expected from the asset, discounted using a rate that reflects the current market value of money and the risks associated with the company’s activity. The recoverable amount also considers the cash flows from the eventual disposal of the asset at the end of its useful life.

If it is not possible to estimate cash flows for a single asset independently, the asset is associated with the smallest operational unit (cash-generating unit) to which it belongs and for which cash flows that are independently identifiable from those generated by other units can be objectively determined. The identification of cash-generating units has been carried out in coherence with the organizational and operational structure of the company.  

In cases where the impairment test highlights a loss in value of an asset, its accounting value is reduced to its recoverable amount.

## Excerpt from the Registry of Companies dated 01/10/2025

### Accounting Value Adjustments and Impairments

If an impairment no longer has a reason to persist, the carrying amount of an asset (or of the cash-generating unit to which it belongs), with the exception of goodwill, is adjusted to the recoverable amount or to its new estimate. However, this adjustment cannot exceed the net carrying amount that the asset would have held if the original impairment had not been recorded, considering the relevant amortizations. The reinstated value is directly recorded in the income statement.

---

### Investments in Subsidiaries

Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at their acquisition cost. To assess the adequacy of carrying amounts, these investments are subjected to an impairment test. If the results indicate that the value is lower than the carrying amount, adjustments are recorded as an impairment loss in the income statement. During subsequent years, if the impairment reasons cease to exist, the investment values are revaluated and adjusted upwards to their original carrying amounts, with the effects recognized in the income statement.

---

### Inventory

Inventory consists of raw materials and finished goods, valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost is determined using the weighted average method. The cost of finished goods directly produced by the company (up until and including the Spring-Summer 2022 season) includes raw materials, labor, and other directly attributable costs of production, excluding financial expenses.  

The estimated net realizable value is based on the selling price predicted under standard business operations, excluding any necessary costs for sale. If there is objective evidence of factors indicating a decline in value, inventory is adjusted to reflect its lower estimated realizable value.

Write-downs are recorded as a reduction of the inventory-related provision directly in the income statement. If the conditions leading to write-downs are no longer present in subsequent fiscal periods, the inventory's value is restored to its historical carrying amount.

---

### Sales Returns and Liabilities for Expected Refunds

The Company estimates variable considerations to include in the transaction price for sold goods with a right of return. A predictive model is developed based on historical return data by brand, country, and client, as well as the prices obtained in each selling season. These elements help determine the estimated payment for returns. Future changes in variables linked to historical patterns might influence the expected refund liabilities.

---

### Financial Assets and Liabilities

#### Financial Assets and Derivative Instruments

At the time of initial recognition, financial assets must be categorized within one of the following subcategories according to the following criteria:
- The entity's business model for managing the financial asset; and
- Specific characteristics of the contractual cash flows of the financial asset.

## Financial Activities

Financial activities are subsequently removed from the financial statements only if the transfer resulted in the substantial transfer of all risks and benefits associated with these activities. Conversely, if a significant portion of the risks and benefits relating to the transferred financial activities is retained, these financial activities continue to be recorded in the statements, even if their legal ownership has been effectively transferred.

### **Financial Activities Measured at Amortized Cost**
This category includes financial activities that meet both of the following conditions:

- The financial activity is managed under a business model aimed at achieving the collection of contractual cash flows (Business model "Hold to Collect");  
- The contractual terms of the financial activity establish, at certain dates, cash flows that consist exclusively of payments of principal and interest on the principal amount to be repaid (i.e., the "SPPI test" is passed).

At the time of initial recognition, these activities are recorded at fair value, including directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, these financial activities are measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest rate method. The amortized cost method is not used for these activities when they are short-term — where the impact of discounting is immaterial. This method is also not applied to credit facilities without fixed maturity dates but subject to revocation.

---

### **Financial Activities Measured at Fair Value with Impact on Comprehensive Income**
This category includes financial activities that meet both of the following conditions:

- The financial activity is managed under a business model aimed at achieving cash flow generation through the sale of financial activities (Business model "Hold to Collect and Sell");  
- The contractual terms of the financial activity establish, at certain dates, cash flows that consist exclusively of payments of principal and interest on the principal amount to be repaid (i.e., the "SPPI test" is passed).

This category also includes equity investments that are not classified as being under control, joint control, or significant influence, and are not held for trading purposes. A designation at initial recognition as "measured at fair value with an impact on comprehensive income" can be made.  

At the time of the initial recognition, the activities are recorded at fair value, including directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, equity investments not under control, joint control, or significant influence are also measured at fair value, and unrealized amounts are recorded in equity (Prospective Comprehensive Income). These amounts cannot subsequently be transferred to the income statement, not even upon realization. This does not apply to associated dividends, which are instead recognized as income when due.  

For equity securities included in this category, not listed in a regulated market, the cost criterion may be used only when the residual use is limited to specific circumstances: for example, because the most recent information to evaluate fair value is insufficient or there is a wide range of possible estimates.

## Evaluation of Fair Value  
The cost represents the best estimate of fair value within such a range of values.

### Financial Assets Measured at Fair Value with Economic Impact  
Financial assets not classified as "Financial assets at amortized cost" or under "Financial assets measured at fair value with an impact on comprehensive income" are included in this category.  

This category includes financial assets held for trading and derivative contracts not classified as hedging instruments (which are represented as assets if fair value is positive or liabilities if fair value is negative).

### Impairment of Financial Assets  
In accordance with the provisions of IFRS 9, the Company applies a simplified approach to estimate credit losses over the entire life of the instrument, considering its historical experience regarding credit losses, adjusted for prospective factors specific to the nature of the Company’s receivables and the economic context.

In summary, the Group evaluates expected credit losses from financial assets as follows:
- A weighted and objective evaluation based on the probability of a range of potential results;
- The time value of money; and
- Reasonable and demonstrable information available without excessive cost or effort, based on past, current, and future economic condition projections relevant to the financial asset.  

Financial asset deterioration occurs when one or more events that negatively impact the expected future cash flows of the financial asset are identified. Evidence of deterioration includes observable data relating to the following events (though it may not be possible to pinpoint one single event). Deterioration may result from:

a) Significant financial difficulty of the issuer or debtor;  
b) A breach of contract, such as a default or a missed payment;  
c) For legal or economic reasons due to debtor financial difficulties, the creditor grants concessions otherwise unavailable;  
d) The likelihood of debtor bankruptcy or other financial restructuring procedures;  
e) The disappearance of an active market for the financial asset due to financial distress; or  
f) The acquisition of a financial asset at a significant discount reflecting credit losses already sustained.  

For financial assets recorded at amortized cost, when a deterioration in value is identified, its value is recalculated as the difference between the book value of the asset and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original interest rate. This value adjustment is recognized in profit and loss.

### Lease Activities  
Lease activities refer exclusively to contracts of active subleases tied to passive lease contracts recognized under IFRS 16. As a result of the active sublease, the right-of-use asset inherent to the passive lease contract is derecognized.

### Public Contributions
Public contributions, including non-monetary contributions evaluated at fair value, are recorded when there is reasonable certainty that they will be received and that the Company will comply with the conditions established for their issuance.  

### Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits include cash on hand and deposits at sight or short term. For the latter, the original maturity does not exceed three months, are readily convertible into cash, and have an insignificant risk of value variation. Elements included in cash and cash equivalents are valued at fair value. Deposits bound by restrictions or not fulfilling IFRS requirements are excluded. Bank deposits with original maturity equal to or greater than three months that do not meet IAS 7 requirements are included in a specific current asset category.  

Cash operations are recorded based on their bank operation dates, while payments are recorded based on the date funds are available.  

---

### Financial Liabilities Other Than Derivative Instruments
The Company does not hold financial liabilities for trading purposes.  

Financial liabilities and trade debts are recorded when the Company becomes a part of applicable contractual agreements. They are initially valued at fair value, adjusted for directly assignable transaction costs. Subsequently, they are evaluated using the amortized cost criterion, employing the effective interest rate method.  

---

### Derecognition of Financial Assets and Liabilities  
Financial assets are derecognized when one of the following conditions is fulfilled:
- The contractual right to receive cash flows from the asset has expired;
- The Company has substantially transferred all risks and benefits related to the asset;
- The Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all risks and benefits related to the financial asset but no longer retains control.

Financial liabilities are removed from the accounting records when they are extinguished, i.e., when the obligation is fulfilled, canceled, or expired. Debt instrument modifications that substantially alter the original terms must be recorded as an extinction of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new liability.

## Recognition of Financial Liabilities - Modification of Terms
Similarly, a substantial variation in the contractual terms of an existing financial liability, even if partial, must be accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.

---

### Offset of Financial Assets and Liabilities
The Company offsets financial assets and financial liabilities only if:  
- There is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts in the financial statements;  
- There is an intention to either offset on a net basis or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.  

---

### Fair Value Evaluation
The fair value evaluation and related disclosures are conducted in accordance with **IFRS 13 - Fair Value Measurement**.  

The fair value represents the price that would be received for the sale of an asset, or paid for the transfer of a liability, in a transaction between participants in an active and orderly market, as of the measurement date.  

The evaluation of fair value is based on the presumption that the sale of the asset or transfer of liability occurs in the principal market, i.e., the market with the greatest volume and level of transactions for the asset or liability. If no principal market exists, it is assumed the transaction occurs in the most advantageous market where the company has market access. This ensures maximization of the outcomes from the sale transaction of the asset or minimizes the amount payable to transfer the liability.  

The fair value of an asset or liability is determined by considering the assumptions that market participants would use to establish the price of the asset or liability, assuming they act as economically rational entities. Market participants are independent, informed, and motivated to enter into a transaction for the asset or liability and are not compelled or under duress.  

---

### Determination of Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair value of listed financial instruments is determined based on prices directly observable from the market. For unlisted financial instruments, fair value is determined using specific valuation techniques that use the maximum possible inputs observable in the market.  
In circumstances where this is not possible, inputs are estimated by management based on the characteristics of the financial instruments being valued. Variations in assumptions employed in estimating such inputs could affect the reported fair value in the financial statement.  

Below is the hierarchy of financial instrument levels classified based on the significance of the inputs used in the determination of fair value (IFRS 13 - Fair Value Measurement):  

- **Level 1:** Quoted price (active market): Data utilized in valuations includes prices of identical assets and liabilities publicly traded in active markets;  
- **Level 2:** Use of observable market data for the valuation (e.g., interest rates provided by the Bank of Italy, yield curves, market volatility from Bloomberg, or credit spreads calculated based on Credit Default Swaps, etc.) not included under Level 1;  
- **Level 3:** Use of unobservable assumptions (internal assumptions such as cash flows, forecasts, etc.).

### **Derivative Financial Instruments**  

Jil Sander S.p.A. uses derivative financial instruments to manage risks arising from exchange rate fluctuations. These derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value on the contract date; subsequently, their fair value is periodically re-measured. They are reported as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when negative.  

Upon entering into the contract, the company designates and documents the existence of a hedging relationship, specifying the identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the correlation between the two, and the nature of the risk. This includes the hedging objectives, the risk management strategy, and the methodology employed to verify prospective and retrospective effectiveness.  

The effectiveness of each hedge is assessed at the initiation of each derivative instrument and throughout its life, particularly at each balance sheet date. Generally, a hedge is considered highly "effective" if, at inception and throughout its life, the changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item are substantially offset by the changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedging instrument.  

The IFRS 9 principle mandates distinguishing between the following types of hedges:  

- **Fair Value Hedges**: These are intended to hedge against the risk of changes in the fair value of an underlying asset or liability. The fair value changes of the derivative designated as a fair value hedge are recognized directly in the income statement.  

- **Cash Flow Hedges**: These are used to mitigate exposure to variability in cash flows attributed to specific risks related to an underlying asset, liability, or forecasted transaction. The effective portion of gains or losses on the derivative is recognized in equity under the reserve for cash flow hedges, while the ineffective portion is posted to the income statement. When the hedged cash flow affects the income statement, the reserve amount is transferred to the income statement as well.  

- **Net Investment Hedges**: These relate to foreign investments. Unlike other fair value fluctuations recognized at year-end, the differential of derivative contracts settled at predefined dates is recorded as a current-period income regardless of the derivative's purpose.  

The hedging relationship ceases to exist under the following conditions:  

- The derivative expires, is sold, terminated, or exercised;  
- The hedged item is sold, matures, or is redeemed;  
- It is no longer probable that the hedging transaction will occur.  

If a derivative no longer qualifies as a hedging instrument, fair value changes are reported directly in the income statement for the period.  

---

### **Employee Benefits**  

Short-term benefits include salaries, wages, social security contributions, substitute indemnities, and incentives payable in the form of bonuses within twelve months of the balance sheet date. These benefits are recognized as components of personnel costs for the period in which the related work service is performed.

## Employee Benefits and Liabilities

The benefits provided to employees are granted upon or subsequent to the cessation of the employment relationship through defined benefit schemes (Severance Pay - "TFR") or other long-term benefits (retirement indemnity) and are recognized during the rights' period of accrual.

For defined benefit plans, which include severance treatment owed to employees under Article 2120 of the Civil Code, the amount of the benefit provided to employees is only determinable after the employment relationship terminates. It is linked to one or more factors such as age, years of service, and acknowledged compensation; therefore, the related expense is charged to the profit and loss account based on actuarial calculations.  

The liabilities recognized in the financial statements for defined benefit plans correspond to the present actuarial value of the obligation at the reporting date. The obligations for defined benefit plans are determined annually by an independent actuary using the **projected unit credit method**.

The current value of a defined benefit plan is calculated by discounting future cash outflows at an interest rate consistent with that of high-grade corporate bonds denominated in euros and with a maturity closely matching the duration of the respective pension plan. Gains and losses deriving from these adjustments and changes in the actuarial hypotheses are recognized in the overall income account.

It is noted that from January 1, 2007, per financial law 2007 and related regulatory decrees, changes were introduced to TFR regulations, requiring employees to decide on whether to direct their accrued TFR to a pension fund or leave it as per the traditional severance scheme. For companies with at least 50 employees, amounts accrued after the specified date represent **defined contribution plans** and are not subject to actuarial valuation, as the company’s liability is limited to the contribution payment to the selected fund.

---

## Provisions for Risks and Charges

Liabilities of a certain or probable nature, but whose occurrence date and financial impact are indeterminate, are recognized in the financial statements only if they represent a likely future obligation resulting from a past event and if their financial amount can be reliably estimated.

The financial statement recognition occurs when an actual, legal, or constructive obligation arises, and an expected financial outflow is probable to meet the obligation. If the effect is significant, the estimated obligation discharge date is sufficiently foreseeable, and the financial cash flows are discounted, reflecting current market rates and specific risk factors of the liability.

Provisions expected to discharge after 12 months from the reference date are classified as non-current liabilities. Conversely, provisions requiring resource employment within one year are classified as current liabilities. Only disclosed in the notes are risks considered possible, for which no allocation is made.

## Revenues

Revenues from contracts with customers are recognized when the following conditions are met:  
- The contract with the customer is identified;  
- The contractual obligations ("performance obligations") contained in the contract are identified;  
- The price is determined;  
- The price is allocated to the individual contractual obligations contained in the contract;  
- The contractual obligation contained in the contract is fulfilled.  

The company recognizes revenues from contracts with customers when (or as) it fulfills the contractual obligation by transferring to the customer the promised good or service (i.e., the activity). The activity is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control.  

With reference to the main types of revenues generated by the company, their recognition is explained in greater detail below based on the following criteria:  

### • Wholesale Sales  
The company distributes products in the wholesale market. Related revenues are recognized at the moment when the significant risks and benefits are transferred to the buyer.  

Revenues are typically recognized at the moment of shipment or delivery of the goods to the customer, identifying the instant when the substantial risks and benefits relating to ownership are transferred. Payment is normally immediate upon delivery. The company closely monitors contractual conditions and recognized rights to ensure they are adhered to.  

In certain cases, commercial conditions may not result in the transfer of risks associated with ownership of the goods (e.g., in cases where conditions align with a consignment sale rather than an actual sale). In such cases, revenue recognition occurs when the risks are substantially transferred (e.g., end-of-season or finalized sale off-shelf).  

Risks arising from return rights, valuation risks, or disputes concerning obligations may require the recognition of an accrual or future refund provision, reflecting a deduction in competent revenues for the gross value of returned goods. Discounts, whether of a financial nature or bonus-related, are accounted for as revenue reductions relevant to the period.  

---

### • Retail Sales  
The company operates in the retail channel through its own store network. Revenues are recognized at the moment of delivery of goods to customers. Sales are usually settled directly in cash or via credit card payments.  

---

### • Provision of Services  
Service revenues are recognized for the accounting period in which services are rendered, in reference to the completion of the service relative to the total agreed service contract.  

---

### • Active Royalties  
Revenues from royalties are recognized based on the provisions of the underlying contracts, typically as a percentage of sales of products branded under licensed agreements.  

Specific amounts related to license renewals are recognized on an accrual basis throughout the duration of the contracts.

---

## Costs  

Costs and expenses are accounted for based on the principle of prudence and on an accrual basis. Those costs related to goods and services sold or consumed during the year are recognized within the relevant period in symmetry with the revenues reported.

## Recognition of Costs  
With reference to the main types of costs incurred by the company, their recognition is based on the following criteria:  

- **Cost of Goods Sold.** The cost of goods sold is recorded in the same period in which the revenue from the sale is recognized.  
- **Expenses for services and other management costs** are recorded in the period in which they are incurred.  
- **Passive Royalties.** These are recognized based on the contractual terms, tied to net sales rather than invoiced sales.  

---

## Financial Proceeds and Expenses  
This includes all items of a financial nature attributable to the income statement for the period, including interest on financial liabilities, calculated using the effective interest method. This primarily concerns overdrafts, medium- to long-term financing, and gains and losses on exchange rates. Revenues and expenses related to interest are allocated to the income statement for the period they are realized/incurred.  

---

## Income Taxes: Current and Deferred  
- **Current income taxes** are determined in accordance with the estimation of taxable income, in compliance with applicable tax regulations.  
- **Deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets** are calculated based on the estimated temporary differences arising between the book value of an asset or liability and its corresponding tax value.  

Deferred tax liabilities and assets related to the carry-forward of fiscal losses are recognized to the extent it is probable that taxable income will be available against which such amounts can be utilized. The deferred and prepaid taxes are calculated using enacted tax rates expected to apply when the differences reverse.  

- Current and deferred taxes are included in the item **"Income Taxes"** on the income statement. The tax-related expenses that are not income-related, such as indirect taxes and tariffs, are presented under **"Other Operating Costs."**

---

## Uncertainty in Tax Treatments  
When dealing with uncertainty regarding tax treatments:  

- It is assessed whether the tax treatment will be accepted by the tax authorities. If it is probable (in the sense of "more likely than not"), the company calculates current or deferred tax balances by applying the provisions of IAS 12 along with the relevant presumptions.  

- If uncertainty exists regarding how the tax treatment is received, its effect is included in the calculation through a method chosen to best resolve the uncertain issue. Each case is considered either independently or jointly with similar treatments to identify the best approach.  

Should the company conclude that a particular treatment is unlikely to be accepted by the tax authority, the effect of such uncertainty is reflected in the tax liabilities or assets.

## Taxation  

The company determines current and deferred taxes using the liability method, considering the most probable value based on the method that best resolves uncertainty.  
The company exercises significant judgment in its professional assessment of identifying tax treatment uncertainties regarding income taxes and regularly reviews judgments and estimates made in the presence of new facts or circumstances altering prior assumptions regarding acceptability.  
When the company identifies uncertainties in its tax positions related to income tax determination, it records uncertain tax positions as either current or deferred taxes.

---

## Currency Operations  

The functional and presentation currency adopted by the company is the euro. Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the single company are initially recorded using the exchange rate on the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate valid on the reporting date. Exchange differences realized or arising from the conversion of monetary items are recognized as income or expense. Non-monetary items in foreign currency, valued at historical cost, are converted using the exchange rate valid on the transaction's initial recognition date.

---

## 4. Risk Management  

The company may face financial and non-financial risks, which require detailed management. It is important to note that the company has implemented robust management and quality control systems to limit unfavorable situations. It has also introduced adequate security measures related to its business activities, in compliance with legal regulations. Notably, the company has been operating under an organization and management model aligned with Legislative Decree 231/2001 since 2019.  

Based on the company’s industry, the following main uncertainties and risks have been identified:

### Market Risk  

Operating in the fashion sector (apparel, footwear, and accessories), the company faces market risk associated with consumer demand for products branded as "Jil Sander." This risk holds significant importance for the company, given the substantial uncertainty about the success of new collections launched each season.  

To mitigate this risk, the company has a well-established structure for research and development of its sample collections. By working in close collaboration with stylists as a team, the company constantly anticipates market trends and successfully promotes its designs through its distribution channels.

---

### Risks Related to Key Personnel  

Operating in the fashion sector, with a strong reliance on know-how, the availability, competency, and expertise of specialized staff are critical.  
The company's performance is closely linked to access to high-level resources with advanced know-how and specialization.

---

## **Loss of Key Personnel**  
The loss of a significant number of highly specialized professionals or entire workgroups dedicated to specific business sectors without adequate replacement, as well as the inability to attract and retain new qualified resources, could potentially have negative effects on the company's prospects, operations, and economic and financial results.

---

## **Interest Rate Risk**  
The company's exposure to interest rate risk is moderate. Given the net financial position, which is mostly in relation to transactions with the parent company, no specific actions were deemed necessary. The OTB Group, through a centralized treasury structure, constantly monitors the company’s financial performance to implement a resource optimization policy.

The returns on the assets and liabilities of the Group’s financial position are mainly indexed to the Euribor/Libor rate for the period, increased by a spread, which depends on the type of agreement. The margins on assets and liabilities applied are aligned with market standards and consistent with the Group's financial stability.

Considering current interest rate levels and their limited volatility, the Group's economic results are sensitive only marginally to interest rate fluctuations.

The table below summarizes the results from the sensitivity analysis performed on interest rate risks, indicating the economic impact as required by IFRS 7.

| Year of Reference | Net Financial Assets (Liabilities) | Increase/(Decrease) in Interest Rate | Revenues (+/-) | Increase/(Decrease) in Net Equity |  
|-------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------|  
| 2022 | 4,733,048 | +1% | 47,330 | 47,330 |  
| 2022 | 4,733,048 | -1% | (47,330) | (47,330) |  
| 2023 | (27,220,166)| +1% | (272,202) | (272,202) |  
| 2023 | (27,220,166)| -1% | 272,202 | 272,202 |  

---

## **Currency Risk**  
The company carries out a portion of its sales based on foreign price lists, developed before the sales campaign, starting from industrial production costs expressed in euros, known at that time.

Subsequently, due to the dynamics of delivery times and standard payment conditions granted to customers, sales collections occur with a delay of about seven/nine months relative to the establishment of the selling price based on the price list. Given this situation, the company adopts strategies to safeguard against currency exchange rate fluctuations (EUR/USD), based on anticipated sales in each market outside the EU, where deemed necessary. This is carried out with the support of the Group Treasury by establishing currency forward contracts with fixed payment terms and amounts aligned with expected cash flows from Non-EU customers.

The OTB Group is equipped with a foreign exchange hedge policy, aligned with market practices and international accounting standards, aiming to minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the Group's anticipated economic margins.

### Liquidity Risk  

Managing liquidity risk addresses the possibility that the company’s available financial resources may not be sufficient to meet financial and commercial obligations within the terms and deadlines set.  
Thanks to being part of the OTB Group, the company has the opportunity to use the liquidity provided by the parent company, OTB SPA, through an intercompany cash pooling current account.

### Credit Risk  

Credit risk is the risk that a client or counterparty to a financial instrument may cause a financial loss by failing to meet an obligation, arising primarily from commercial credit.  
The company’s policy involves using tools such as trade credit insurance and systematic client credibility checks to mitigate this risk.  
To date, there are no significant uncertainties reported regarding the recoverability of receivables recorded on the balance sheet, considering the adjustments made.  

The company has adopted prudent collection policies, also anticipating shipment times, which led to a reduction in recorded losses. Furthermore, diversification in the sales markets helps mitigate this risk.  
For details regarding credit risk derived from receivables by area, seniority, and movement in valuation funds, please refer to explanatory note 6.2 – Trade Receivables.

---

### IT Risk  

The company ensures the constant development of information systems supporting business operations, particularly in terms of technical, commercial, and administrative aspects. This is ensured through continuous upgrades to improve efficiency and effectiveness.

### 5. Spin-off Operation  

On February 10, 2022, the Board of Directors approved the simplified partial spin-off project, resulting in the assignment to the well-known Staff International S.p.A. (beneficiary) of a branch of Jil Sander S.p.A. (divesting company). The spin-off was finalized on July 1, 2022, and on that date, Jil Sander S.p.A. transferred to Staff International S.p.A. the assets and liabilities related to the company branch composed of activities related to the design, development, production, and coordination of logistics for finished product lines, collections of clothing and related accessories for men/women (including bags, shoes, small leather goods, and jewelry) recent to the “Jil Sander” trademark and its derivatives.  

The difference between the overall value of the active and passive elements constituting the transferred equity section in favor of the beneficiary, based on the details specified in the spin-off project, is €42,450,000. Following the spin-off, the net book value of the assets of Jil Sander S.p.A. decreased by this amount.

The increments of the assets by right of use are primarily related to new lease contracts for stores and offices signed during the year, as well as the indexing of the lease contracts. Conversely, the decrements are mainly due to the conclusion of certain lease contracts.

The company annually performs impairment tests on CGU, and the results of the impairment tests as of the reporting date confirmed that the revaluations from previous years no longer need to be maintained. Consequently, the book value of the assets was adjusted to the gross carrying amount that they would have had if the loss on value or related amortization had not been made. The value recovery was charged to the income statement.

The value of assets by right of use is recorded in the balance sheet as the difference between each individual cost value and the accumulated amortization, resulting in a net value of € 33,059,352.

The changes in the historical cost and depreciation/impairment funds for tangible fixed assets during the period from January 1 to December 31, 2023, are presented in the above table.  

**Key Notes**:
1. The increases are primarily due to work performed on the property owned in Tavarnuzze, in the province of Florence, and improvements made to the new flagship stores in Rome and Venice.  
2. The depreciation adjustments in the previous periods were necessary due to plans to dismiss a property currently used by the Company.  

The book value of tangible fixed assets is EUR 4,323,757, representing the difference between the historical cost and the depreciation/impairment funds.

Following the business unit split detailed in paragraph 5, the Company transferred production activities to its affiliate, *Staff International S.P.A.*, from which it purchases products for resale. As a result, as of the balance sheet date, the Company was completing the disposal of raw materials no longer usable, valuated at their recoverable value.

## Current Financial Assets  

| **Description**                                            | **2023 (€)**   | **2022 (€)**   |
|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Correspondence accounts with parent company                | 14,507,749     | 37,778,782     |
| Forward exchange contracts                                 | 2,117,723      | 955,943        |
| Credits for lease agreements                               | 674,460        | 973,574        |
| **Total current financial assets**                        | **17,299,932** | **39,708,299** |

In 2021, the company entered into an **Intragroup Treasury Management Agreement** with its parent company, OTB S.p.A., which oversees the financial management of the Jil Sander group.

In 2022, Jil Sander S.p.A. signed several lease agreements for equipped spaces with an affiliated company. The contracts were accounted for by applying **IFRS 16**, specifically for the lease component related to space availability. As a result, the Company recognized a credit corresponding to the net present value of future lease payments.

## 6.11 Other Current Assets  

The detailed balance is as follows:

| **Description**                     | **2023 (€)**   | **2022 (€)**   |
|-------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| VAT credits and similar taxes       | 8,299,690      | 844,168        |
| Expected refund activities          | 840,370        | 0              |
| Advances to suppliers               | 412,537        | 274,347        |
| Other receivables                   | 234,536        | 48,348         |
| Accrued income                      | 164,622        | 59,148         |
| Employee loans and advances         | 1,675          | 0              |
| **Total other current assets**      | **9,953,431**  | **1,226,011**  |

The increase in VAT credits is due to a significant rise in purchase volumes compared to the prior fiscal year. The VAT threshold of the Company, based on the volumes of the previous fiscal year, was insufficient to meet the needs of its main Italian suppliers when issuing invoices that applied the tax.

The **expected refund activities** stem from an evaluation of the risks associated with rights of return. This results in the recording of a liability in the balance sheet for future refunds and the corresponding reduction in revenue for the gross value of expected returns. On the one hand, this involves entering a receivable for return rights and the corresponding cost reduction for the expected returns.

The **Trattamento di Fine Rapporto (TFR)** (Severance Pay Fund) is included in defined benefit plans. To determine the liability, the **Projected Unit Credit Method** has been applied, structured into the following phases:

- **Projection of benefits:** Based on a set of financial assumptions (e.g., cost of living increase, salary increase, etc.), possible future payments have been estimated, which would be disbursed to each employee enrolled in the plan in cases such as retirement, death, disability, resignation, etc. The estimate includes potential increases corresponding to additional seniority accrued, as well as the presumed growth in the salary level at the valuation date.

- **Discounting to present value:** The liability has been calculated by applying an annual discount rate, taking into account the probability of each payment actually being disbursed and determining the average present value of future benefits.

- **Recognition of liability in financial statements:** The amount of the actuarial liability recorded by the company corresponds to the portion of the present value of future benefits accrued by employees for their service up to the valuation date.

The TFR is used to cover advances granted to employees and for settlements upon termination.

### Key Actuarial Assumptions for TFR

| **Year** | **Inflation Rate** | **Discount Rate** | **TFR Growth Rate** |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 2022     | 2.50%              | 3.70%            | 3.38%               |
| 2023     | 2.30%              | 3.17%            | 3.23%               |

## **6.16 Trade Payables**

The details of trade payables are as follows:  

| **2023**         | **2022**         |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Trade payables to third parties         | 6,803,669  | 12,738,980 |
| Trade payables to subsidiaries         | 14,625,608 | 8,341,536  |

| **Total Trade Payables**                | **58,071,856** | **44,538,921** |

Trade payables to third parties as of December 31, 2022, included payables arising from the acquisition by OTB and the consequent reorganization process.

The parent company is OTB S.p.A.  

The related companies are entities—different from subsidiaries and parent companies—belonging to the OTB group. The increase in trade payables to related companies was due to an increase in payables owed to Staff International S.p.A., which provides the company with finished products and services for prototyping and product development. The payables to Jil Sander GmbH, which holds the license agreement for the "Jil Sander" brand with Jil Sander S.p.A., also increased.

Below is the breakdown by geographical area:

### Provisions for Risks and Charges (6.18)

The **provision for risks related to refunds for expected returns** is tied to the valuation of risks associated with granting return rights to customers. As previously noted, this valuation leads to the recognition of a liability for refunds of future returns and the corresponding reduction in sales revenue. On the one hand, the gross value of expected returns is recognized; on the other, the activity related to returned goods and the associated cost reductions are recorded.

At the end of the financial year, the company conducts a precise analysis of the turnover to identify products for which the risks have not yet been fully transferred to the customer, based on the applied Incoterms. Revenue related to such products is deferred to the next financial year by recording a deferred income liability.

In light of the positive results achieved by the Company and those anticipated in the budget for the year 2024, the administrators decided to release the portion of the tax losses that can be carried forward. It is noted that deferred taxes on carryforward tax losses amounting to €2,900,884 have not been recorded.

The new OECD rules regarding Pillar 2 are deemed applicable to the OTB Group, to which your company belongs, as the regulation was officially enacted in Italy and came into effect as of January 1, 2024. However, since the regulation is not effective as of December 31, 2023, the Company has not recorded any impact on current taxes for the fiscal year.  

Based on this regulation, the Group may be required to pay a Top-Up Tax, determined as the difference between the minimum agreed tax level (15%) and the effective tax rate (ETR) in jurisdictions where the ETR is below 15%. For the Italian jurisdiction, to which your Company belongs, the ETR as of December 31, 2023, stands at 15%.

The origin of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities is summarized in the following table:

### Market Scenario and Positioning

Jil Sander operates both nationally and internationally in the luxury sector, establishing itself as a reference entity in the production and commercialization of clothing and leather goods. The range of products focuses on the production of clothing, bags, accessories, and footwear under the brand "Jil Sander," which includes both women's and men's collections.

Over the past year, the global economy experienced growth of 3.1%, despite increasing geopolitical tensions and the persistence of restrictive monetary policies due to high inflation levels. This rate, although lower than the figures from 2022, still surpassed 2%—the objective and maximum limit set by the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank.

Addressing the trends in main reference markets:
- In **Japan**, GDP grew by 2.0%, spurred on by solid domestic demand amidst a sustained recovery and economic support policies implemented by the Japanese government.
- The **Chinese economy** entered a recovery phase compared to 2022, with growth in industrial production, services, and retail sales. However, structural medium- to long-term challenges, including demographic decline and crises in the real estate sector, still pose potential risks for the financial system.
- In **the United States**, GDP increased by 2.5%. Inflation is in a phase of continuous decline but remains at elevated levels; interest rates reached their peak levels this year and are projected to decrease progressively in 2024.
- In **the Eurozone**, although recent data registered a technical recession for the first three quarters of 2023 due to a nearly generalized decline in all sectors, including consumer goods, GDP growth for the entire year reached 0.3% compared to 2022.

In **Europe**, economic activity remains weak due to a falling demand trend. Nevertheless, there are notable positive signs, such as the start of inflation's decline and a slight decrease in the unemployment rate.

Turning to **Italy**, GDP growth was 0.7%. Despite tight credit conditions and persistently high energy prices, the trade balance remained positive, and job market conditions reached record levels.

As for the Italian fashion sector, in which your company operates, the past year was one of consolidation. The segment recorded growth driven by increased sales value, but for the first time since the pandemic, volume contracted compared to the previous year.  

The top-line growth was offset by a loss in profitability due to the rise in energy costs and raw material prices, which were not fully compensated for by higher retail prices.

A recent report by the Italian National Fashion Chamber estimates that in 2023, turnover in the sector increased by 4% compared to 2022, reaching €102.8 billion (€98.8 billion in 2022). This growth was mainly driven by exports (+5% versus 2022), along with maintaining a significantly positive trade surplus.

Looking ahead to the coming year, the outlook is a mix of light and shadow. While projections for demand slowdown persist, especially in the first part of the year, the industry as a whole remains resilient. Increasingly, the sector focuses on investments tied to environmental and social sustainability initiatives, as well as those tied to digital transformation.

### Business Performance and Management of Jil Sander

During the fiscal year, the company recorded growth in its revenue, primarily through the expansion of its direct channels by opening two new stores in Italy and accelerating efforts towards omnichannel operations from May 2023 onwards.

All geographical areas in which the company operates reported increased revenue—a trend attributed to the fact that the Jil Sander group has a more structured approach with offices in all regions dedicated to managing operational and commercial aspects.

Regarding the aforementioned retail channel expansion, it is worth noting that during the fiscal year, two monobrand stores were opened in Italy: one in Piazza San Marco in Venice and the other in Piazza di Spagna in Rome. Through its Spanish branch, the first monobrand store was opened in Madrid, at the Canalejas Gallery. Meanwhile, the newly established Dutch branch has focused its efforts on opening a concession at De Bijenkorf in Amsterdam, pending the launch of the first Dutch monobrand store scheduled for 2024.

The retail channel expansion included all regions in which the Jil Sander group operates. As of 31/12/2023, the total number of stores reached 57 (19 in EMEA, 20 in Japan, 4 in the USA, and 14 in APAC) with 7 outlets (3 in EMEA, 3 in Japan, 1 in the USA), expanding the store network by 14 points compared to 2022.

This year's growth was partly slowed down by delays in product deliveries, which primarily impacted the wholesale channel but also had significant effects on direct sales channels. These delays initially affected delivery volumes compared to orders; later on, they significantly influenced sales volumes from clients in subsequent sales campaigns related to the two 2024 seasons.

To manage the substantial increase in stock due to production delays, operational mechanisms were introduced early to focus on inventory management. This was done to ensure efficient clearance of excess stock, improve product turnover, reduce the impact on working capital, and subsequently improve the company’s financial position. This management, while avoiding disorderly clearances of the large surplus of finished products, accelerated the global outlet network in some cases as a temporary solution.

The return to efficient stock management is expected during the 2024 fiscal year.

Finally, it should be noted that new office spaces were leased in addition to existing ones on the third floor of Foro Buonaparte to better accommodate product development and prototyping processes carried out together with Staff International.

The 2023 economic report reflects the growth in revenue as a result of the strong expansion of the brand, both in its domestic market and in other regions governed by subsidiaries.  

The EBIT result shows a decrease of €1,527,000, representing a 2.3% decline, equivalent to a 1.9pp contraction. This result accounts for investments in the development of the retail channel in Italy and Spain, as well as the higher costs of the central structures used to coordinate the brand's development activities.  

The amount of financial charges is mainly due to:  
- **€28,022** (€1,896 in 2022): interest payments on loans,  
- **€559,791** (€466,969 in 2022): accounting for interest on lease liabilities (under IFRS 16).  

The company also realized during the fiscal year currency exchange gains amounting to €1,529,869 (loss of €28,914 in 2022).  

The year's taxation at **€-7,721,152** is detailed as follows:  

| **Taxes (in €)**                | **2023**      | **2022**     |
|---------------------------------|---------------|--------------|
| Current taxes                  | (63,481)      | 194,184      |

### Indicators of Financial Structure  

|                | **2023** | **2022**  |
|----------------|----------|-----------|
| Fixed assets as a percentage of total assets | 30.3%    | 31.5%     |
| Working capital as a percentage of total assets | 15.8%    | 2.4%      |
| Net assets as a percentage of total liabilities | -62.5%   | -68.3%    |

The indicators shown above highlight the maintenance of a balanced situation, thanks to the positive results achieved during the year. The increase in the working capital ratio to total assets—substantially attributable to the increase in inventory—is due to the growth in sales volumes and the reorganization of production and logistics processes, which resulted in streamlining production lead times and delivery to customers. The rationalization of these processes was completed before the end of the fiscal year.

### Indicators of Economic Performance  

#### **ROE**
|                | **2023** | **2022** |
|----------------|----------|----------|
| ROE            | 10.7%    | 27.2%    |

ROE is the ratio of net income to the Group's net equity. It synthetically expresses the profitability and return on equity. It stands at values more positive in this fiscal year, even though lower compared to the previous year. During the fiscal year, costs were sustained to develop new sales channels (omnichannel, stores, markets), which will contribute fully to profitability starting from the 2024 fiscal year.

#### **ROI**
|                | **2023** | **2022** |
|----------------|----------|----------|
| ROI            | 1.9%     | 3.2%     |

ROI is the ratio of EBIT to net capital invested. It measures the profitability of invested capital, where profitability refers to gross profit from business operations, excluding extraordinary items and tax pressure. The same observations made regarding ROE apply.

#### **ROS**
|                | **2023** | **2022** |
|----------------|----------|----------|
| ROS            | 2.3%     | 4.2%     |

ROS is the ratio of EBIT to sales revenue. It expresses the Group's ability to generate profit from sales, with the index interpreted as the profit margin the Group benefits from in selling manufactured goods. The same observations made for ROE apply.

### Productivity Indicators  

|                    | **2023** | **2022** |
|--------------------|----------|----------|

### **Indicators of Financial Situation**

#### **Fixed Capital Coverage Index**
| Year  | Value   |
|-------|---------|
| 2023  | -127.1% |
| 2022  | -128.7% |

This index results from the ratio between net equity and total fixed assets. It helps assess whether net equity is sufficient to wholly or partially cover fixed assets.

#### **Availability Index**
| Year  | Value   |
|-------|---------|
| 2023  | 142.3%  |
| 2022  | 106.6%  |

The index results from the ratio of current assets over short-term liabilities. It measures the group's ability to cover short- and medium-term debts by utilizing its current assets. It allows us to evaluate whether circulating capital is sufficient to cover financing sources acquired from third parties for both commercial and financial purposes. This resilience reflects the company's ability to meet its short-term debt obligations promptly when liquidity is converted to cash.  

#### **Liquidity Index**
| Year  | Value   |
|-------|---------|
| 2023  | 100.6%  |
| 2022  | 145.0%  |

This index complements the availability index by assessing the group's ability to meet short- and medium-term debts using promptly available liquidity (i.e., short-term). It evaluates whether liquidity (sum of credits and liquid assets) is enough to cover financial and commercial liabilities, taking into account inventory weight in the company's operational structure.  

Despite inventory weight taking a significant role in balance sheet structure, this index showcases the group's ability to promptly address current operating needs by focusing on circulating assets net of inventories.

### Information on Principal Risks and Uncertainty

The company's activity may be influenced by financial and non-financial risks detailed as follows. It is necessary to emphasize that the company constantly adopts management and risk monitoring systems to minimize such scenarios; the group also implements adequate security measures in compliance with existing privacy regulations. In light of the sector of operation, the primary risks the company must address are outlined below. Additionally, during the fiscal year, the company adopted the organizational control model compliant with the law 231/01.

---

### Market Risk
Operating under license in the fashion sector (clothing, footwear, knitwear, and leather accessories), the company faces the market risk linked to consumer appreciation of products sold under the Jil Sander brand. This risk represents greater uncertainty for the company regarding the success of collections proposed by various stylists in the market.

To address this, the company has developed an effective structure for studying prototypes and merchandising, whereby it collaborates with stylists in a team effort to constantly assess global market trends, successfully shaping its designs. For the company, market risk is mitigated through diversification of its revenue streams across different geographic markets.

### Credit Risk
Credit risk refers to the potential loss resulting from a client or counterparty of a financial instrument failing to fulfill an obligation, which could lead to financial loss due to non-performance of payment obligations. The OTB Group's policy is to use tools aimed at reducing this risk, such as credit insurance and systematic verification procedures to assess the creditworthiness of clients. 

Currently, there are no significant uncertainties regarding the recoverability of the receivables recorded in the financial statements, taking into account the evaluations performed.  

Operating in the luxury market, which presents its unique credit risks, the Company has adopted collection policies, often pre-emptive, relative to shipments, allowing for reduced recorded credit losses. Additionally, the diversification of target markets helps further mitigate this risk.

---

### Exchange Rate Risk
The Company generates a portion of its sales using a price list expressed in foreign currencies. The price list formulation occurs prior to the sales campaign, based on the analysis of industrial production costs, which are quoted in euros at the time.

Given this, due to the time gap caused by delivery dynamics and the standard payment terms extended to customers, sales collections experience a delay of approximately seven to nine months from the initial price determination based on the price list.  

To safeguard against fluctuations in euro-to-foreign-currency exchange rates, the Company adopts exchange rate hedging policies. For the EU market, where deemed necessary, forward exchange contracts are stipulated with complementary deadlines and amounts, aligned with incoming payment flows from non-EU clients.

---

### Information Technology Risk
The Company consistently ensures continuous development of the IT systems supporting its operations, focusing on technical, commercial, and administrative aspects. This is essential for mitigating the risk of disruptions in operational and managerial information flows.

The Company uses hardware and software architectures that are configured for high reliability, supporting the applications essential for operational activities. Disaster recovery services are also in place to ensure restoration times appropriate to the critical levels of the applications. In 2023, the Company continued its integration of IT systems at the group level.

---

### Risks Related to Cyberattacks ("Cyber Risks")
The growing dependence on and interconnectedness of IT and communication technologies have significantly increased vulnerabilities within IT systems due to the sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks.  

To address this, the OTB Group periodically reviews risks, aiming to invest organizational and technical resources to minimize such risks under the principle of business continuity. No cyberattacks occurred in 2023 and this area remained well-managed.

## Liquidity Risk  
The management of liquidity risk addresses the risk that the financial resources available to the company may not be sufficient to meet financial and commercial obligations within predetermined terms and deadlines.  

---

## Interest Rate Risk  
The company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations, particularly concerning both the national and international markets.  

The interest rate hedging policy, where deemed necessary, is inspired by the following guiding principles. The primary objective is to reduce the volatility of financial charges. This objective is achieved through an appropriate combination of fixed and variable rates in the debt composition. The company does not employ derivative instruments on interest rates for hedging purposes or, for that matter, speculative purposes.  

---

## Personnel Information

Below is a breakdown of human resources as of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022:

## Audit Report on the Financial Statements

### **Opinion**
We conducted the audit of the financial statements of JIL SANDER S.p.A. (the "Company") as of December 31, 2023. The financial statements include the statement of financial position, income statement, comprehensive income statement, the statement of changes in net equity, cash flow statement for the fiscal year ended on that date, and relevant explanatory notes, including the summary of the principal accounting policies applied.  

In our opinion, the financial statements provide a true and fair view of the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and of its financial performance, cash flows, and operations for the fiscal year ended as of that date, in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union.

---

### **Basis for Opinion**
We conducted our audit in accordance with international auditing standards (ISA Italia).  

Our responsibilities according to these standards are further detailed in the section **"Responsibilities of the Independent Auditors for the Audit of Financial Statements"** later in this report.  

We are independent from the Company in accordance with ethical and independence requirements applicable under Italian law regarding the audit of financial statements. We believe the audit evidence we have gathered is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

---

### **Other Considerations**
The Company, as required by law, has included the essential tables and disclosures within the illustrative notes to the financial statements regarding its business activity of direction and coordination. The audit opinion regarding the financial statements of JIL SANDER S.p.A. does not extend to this information.

### **Responsibility of the Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors for the Financial Statements**

The directors are responsible for preparing the financial statements that provide a true and fair view in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union and, within the terms provided by law, for the internal controls deemed necessary to prepare financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error, and for unintentional events.

The directors are also responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue operating as a going concern, preparing the financial statements using the going concern assumption where deemed appropriate, and providing adequate disclosure in this regard. The directors use the going concern assumption in preparing the financial statements unless they evaluate that conditions exist for the dissolution of the company or the cessation of its activity, or unless there are no realistic alternatives to such decisions.

The Board of Statutory Auditors is responsible for monitoring, as established by law, the process of preparing the financial information provided by the company.

---

### **Responsibility of the Audit Firm for the Review of the Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an audit report expressing our opinion. Reasonable assurance represents a high level of certainty, but it is not a guarantee that an audit performed in compliance with international auditing standards (ISA Italy) will always identify material misstatements when these exist. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, singly or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the decisions of users based on the financial statements.

Within the scope of the audit conducted in accordance with international auditing standards (ISA Italy), we exercised professional judgment and maintained professional skepticism throughout the entire audit process. Additionally:

- We identified and assessed risks of material misstatements in the financial statements, due to fraud or unintentional events; planned and performed audit procedures in response to such risks; and obtained sufficient and appropriate audit evidence on which to base our opinion. The risk of not identifying a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, falsification, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the circumvention of internal controls.

- We obtained an understanding of the internal control system relevant to the audit to design audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control system.

- We evaluated the appropriateness of accounting principles and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, including related disclosures.

- We reached the conclusion of the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern assumption in preparing the financial statements, based on the audit evidence we obtained. This includes evaluating whether uncertainty exists regarding events or circumstances that may raise significant doubts about the Company’s ability to continue operating as a going concern. In the presence of significant uncertainty, we are required to draw attention to the corresponding disclosure in the financial statement audit report. Alternatively, if such disclosure is inadequate, we must express a modified opinion. Our conclusions are based on the evidence obtained up to the date of this audit report. However, events or subsequent circumstances may arise that could cause the Company to cease operating as a going concern.  

- We evaluated the presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements as a whole, including the notes to the financial statements, and assessed whether they present the transactions and events in a way that provides a fair representation.  

- We obtained sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the Company to express our opinion on the financial statements.
