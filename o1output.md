This financial statement, within the framework of options provided by IAS 1 [Presentation of Financial Statements], comprises the statement of financial position, the income statement, the comprehensive income statement, the cash flow statement, the statement of changes in equity, and related explanatory notes.

Specifically:  

- In the **financial position statement**, assets and liabilities are reported separately in accordance with the "non-current" and "current" criteria.  

### Current Assets:  
An asset is considered current when:  
- It is expected to be realized, sold, or consumed during the regular operating cycle;  
- It is held primarily for trading purposes;  
- It consists of cash or cash equivalents unless it is restricted for use to settle liabilities for at least twelve months from the balance sheet date.

All other assets are classified as non-current.  

### Current Liabilities:  
A liability is classified as current when:  
- It is expected to be settled during the normal operating cycle;  
- It is held primarily for trading purposes;  
- It is due within twelve months from the reporting period;  
- The entity has no unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting period.

The Company classifies all other liabilities as non-current.  

- In the income statement, cost classification has been carried out following the nature of the expenses;  
- The consolidated cash flow statement has been prepared based on the indirect method per IAS 7, classifying cash flows into operating, investing, and financing activities.
